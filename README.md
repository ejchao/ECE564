Deep Neural Network

Individually, implement a fixed size single stage of a convolutional neural network with a ReLu activation function. This includes planning the design approach, coding the final design in Verilog, and verifying intended functionality.

•	Planned and executed a pipelined streaming architecture.  
•	Debugged the architecture by simulating the code using the provided test benches and sample data files in ModelSim and by running the code through Synopsys Design Vision for synthesis.   

Read project pdf for more details in the design process and verification.
